why wait ?. why not soon --

back then i was naive , kind and nice .people pushed me over , walked over me , then -i thought it was okay and thats how it is supposed to be
you taught me how to be myself , being my self is okay and thats the way its should be.you taught me to stand up for my self and all i wanted is to be more 
like you , impress you . to me you were perfection ,no Flaws no flaws at all even then i knew it was not okay- there is no one person in this world with out flaws, i wanted to see it for mylsef 
only then i would be able to prove myself it isnt just obsesssion . so waited to grow the things that you sparked.
